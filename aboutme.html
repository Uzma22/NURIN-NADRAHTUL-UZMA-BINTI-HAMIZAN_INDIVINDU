						<h3> HELLO EVERYONE </h3>
						<p> Let me introduce myself, I am Uzma 20 years old in this years (2021). I am from Kulim, Kedah. I am shy girl but after we'll meet I will be your crack friends. So, I want to describe my best place that I live now which is Kulim, Kedah. I think Kulim is considered as u-urban because the living cost here are not that high. One of my favourite place in Kulim is Dataran Raudhah I-City Kulim as the view at night is so spectacular than you ever imagined.</p>
						<p> I am student in Library Management and also doing a business as a part time. For me doing a business while studying is a tough for me. It is because I need to manage my time wisely for studying and handling a business. Even though is a bit tough for me, I still enjoying my life.
						</p>
						<p> Actually I very enjoy in my studying, because I get more friends, gain experiences and learn new knowledge. The best way that I did when I study I will listen to Surah Ar-Rahman. It works for me, I feel more calm and peace. Sometime I will listen the songs from the Youtube. It's a random chill song. I always listen the song and Surah because I want to avoid from being bored and sleepy. So, I need something entertainment while studying. This my tricks while studying, how about you guys?
